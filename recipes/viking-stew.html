    <p>
      This Viking stew, made with meat, berries, mushrooms, plenty of fresh herbs,
      and root vegetables typically available to the Vikings, is a seemingly primitive
      dish with a remarkably sophisticated flavor. It works with any meat, so if you
      cannot hunt for wild boar, do not be dismayedâ€”you can still make it!

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Add pork to a large soup pot or Dutch oven. Add salt, honey, berries, lingonberry jam, and cold water, and
          turn the heat to high.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>While stew is coming to a boil, add garlic, dry thyme, and ground coriander. When mixture comes to a rolling
          boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer gently for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Stir in onion, leeks, and mushrooms, and simmer until meat is almost, but not quite fork tender, about 45
          minutes more.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Stir in cabbage, carrots, and fennel; continue to simmer until vegetables and meat are very tender, about 30
          minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Season to taste with salt. Serve with fresh herbs scattered over the top.</p>
